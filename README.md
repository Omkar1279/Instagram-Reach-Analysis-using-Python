## Overview

Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms today, used by millions of people to promote their businesses, build portfolios, blog, and create content. As Instagramâ€™s algorithms constantly evolve, the reach of posts fluctuates, affecting content visibility. This project focuses on understanding these changes through data analysis and predicting post reach.

This project includes:
- Data analysis of Instagram metrics such as impressions from home, hashtags, explore, and other sources.
- Visualization of key insights using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- WordClouds to understand caption and hashtag usage trends.
- Predictive modeling using machine learning to forecast post reach.

## Dataset

The dataset contains manually collected Instagram post metrics, including:
- **Impressions** (From Home, Hashtags, Explore, etc.)
- **Engagement** (Likes, Comments, Shares, Saves, Follows)
- **Post details** (Captions, Hashtags)

You can download the dataset from [here](https://statso.io/instagram-reach-analysis-case-study/).

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the necessary Python dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omkar1279/instagram-reach-analysis.git
cd instagram-reach-analysis
```

### Dependencies
The main libraries required for this project are:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- sklearn
- wordcloud

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the dataset or use your Instagram data.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook or run the Python script for analysis.

### Running the analysis

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('Instagram.csv', encoding='latin1')

# Clean the data and perform analysis
data = data.dropna()
```

## Visualizations

This project generates several visualizations to help you understand Instagram reach trends:
- **Distribution of Impressions**: Understand the reach from home, hashtags, explore, etc.
- **Donut Plot of Impressions by Source**: Visualize which sources contribute the most to post reach.
- **WordCloud of Captions and Hashtags**: Identify frequently used words in captions and hashtags.
- **Scatter Plots**: Understand relationships between likes, impressions, and engagement.

### Example: Distribution of Impressions

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.title("Distribution of Impressions From Home")
sns.distplot(data['From Home'])
plt.show()
```

## Predicting Instagram Reach

Using **PassiveAggressiveRegressor** from Scikit-learn, the project predicts the reach of Instagram posts based on features such as:
- Impressions
- Saves, Likes, Shares, Comments
- Profile Visits, Follows

Example code snippet for model training:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import PassiveAggressiveRegressor

# Train-test split
X = data[['Impressions', 'Saves', 'Likes', 'Shares', 'Comments']]
y = data['Follows']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = PassiveAggressiveRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **pandas, numpy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib, seaborn, plotly**: Data visualization libraries.
- **sklearn**: For machine learning and predictions.
- **wordcloud**: For text analysis of captions and hashtags.
